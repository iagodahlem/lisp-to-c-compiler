# lisp-to-c-compiler

Learning how modern compilers work, by implementing a [super tiny compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler/blob/master/the-super-tiny-compiler.js) that compiles lisp-like function calls into some C-like function calls.

Go check [the super tiny compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler) if you want to implement yourself.

Thanks [@jamiebuilds](https://github.com/jamiebuilds) for this super cool and well-written guide.
